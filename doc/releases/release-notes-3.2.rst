API Changes
***********

Changes in this release
=======================

* Zephyr now requires Python 3.8 or higher

* Changed :c:struct:`spi_cs_control` to remove anonymous struct.
  This causes possible breakage for static initialization of the
  struct.  Updated :c:macro:`SPI_CS_CONTROL_PTR_DT` to reflect
  this change.

* The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LEGACY_INCLUDE_PATH` option has been disabled by
  default, all upstream code and modules have been converted to use
  ``<zephyr/...>`` header paths. The option is still available to facilitate
  the migration of external applications, but will be removed with the 3.4
  release.  The :zephyr_file:`scripts/utils/migrate_includes.py` script is
  provided to automate the migration.

* :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/zephyr.h` no longer defines ``__ZEPHYR__``.
  This definition can be used by third-party code to compile code conditional
  to Zephyr. The definition is already injected by the Zephyr build system.
  Therefore, any third-party code integrated using the Zephyr build system will
  require no changes. External build systems will need to inject the definition
  by themselves, if they did not already.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* The following functions, macros, and structures related to the
  deprecated kernel work queue API have been removed:

  * ``k_work_pending()``
  * ``k_work_q_start()``
  * ``k_delayed_work``
  * ``k_delayed_work_init()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_submit_to_queue()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_submit()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_pending()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_cancel()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_remaining_get()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_expires_ticks()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_remaining_ticks()``
  * ``K_DELAYED_WORK_DEFINE``

* Removed support for enabling passthrough mode on MPU9150 to
  AK8975 sensor.

* Removed deprecated SPI :c:struct:`spi_cs_control` fields for GPIO management
  that have been replaced with :c:struct:`gpio_dt_spec`.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* :c:macro:`DT_SPI_DEV_CS_GPIOS_LABEL` and
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_SPI_DEV_CS_GPIOS_LABEL` are deprecated in favor of
  utilizing :c:macro:`DT_SPI_DEV_CS_GPIOS_CTLR` and variants.

* :c:macro:`DT_GPIO_LABEL`, :c:macro:`DT_INST_GPIO_LABEL`,
  :c:macro:`DT_GPIO_LABEL_BY_IDX`, and :c:macro:`DT_INST_GPIO_LABEL_BY_IDX`,
  are deprecated in favor of utilizing :c:macro:`DT_GPIO_CTLR` and variants.

* :c:macro:`DT_LABEL`, and :c:macro:`DT_INST_LABEL`, are deprecated
  in favor of utilizing :c:macro:`DT_PROP` and variants.

* :c:macro:`DT_BUS_LABEL`, and :c:macro:`DT_INST_BUS_LABEL`, are deprecated
  in favor of utilizing :c:macro:`DT_BUS` and variants.

* STM32 LPTIM domain clock should now be configured using devicetree.
  Related Kconfig :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_STM32_LPTIM_CLOCK` option is now
  deprecated.

* 'label' property from devicetree as a base property.  The property is still
   valid for specific bindings to specify like :dtcompatible:`gpio-leds` and
   :dtcompatible:`fixed-partitions`.

Stable API changes in this release
==================================

New APIs in this release
========================

Kernel
******

* Source files using multiple :c:macro:`SYS_INIT` macros with the
  same initialisation function must now use :c:macro:`SYS_INIT_NAMED`
  with unique names per instance.

Architectures
*************

* ARM

  * AARCH32

  * AARCH64

* Xtensa

Bluetooth
*********

* Audio

* Direction Finding

* Host

  * Added a new callback :c:func:`rpa_expired` in the struct :c:struct:`bt_le_ext_adv_cb`
    to enable synchronization of the advertising payload updates with the Resolvable Private
    Address (RPA) rotations when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_PRIVACY` is enabled.
  * Added a new :c:func:`bt_le_set_rpa_timeout()` API call to dynamically change the
    the Resolvable Private Address (RPA) timeout when the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_RPA_TIMEOUT_DYNAMIC`
    is enabled.
  * Added :c:func:`bt_conn_auth_cb_overlay` to overlay authentication callbacks for a Bluetooth LE connection.
  * Removed ``CONFIG_BT_HCI_ECC_STACK_SIZE``.
    The Bluetooth long workqueue (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_LONG_WQ`) is used for processing ECC commands instead of the dedicated thread.
  * :c:func:`bt_conn_get_security` and `bt_conn_enc_key_size` now take a ``const struct bt_conn*`` argument.

* Mesh

* Controller

* HCI Driver
