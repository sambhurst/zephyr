compatible: "nordic,nrf-led-matrix"

include: display-controller.yaml

properties:
    row-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Array of GPIOs to be used as rows of the matrix.

    col-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Array of GPIOs to be used as columns of the matrix.

    pixel-mapping:
      type: uint8-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Array of bytes that specify which rows and columns of the matrix
        control its particular pixels, line by line. Each byte in this
        array corresponds to one pixel of the matrix and specifies the row
        index in the high nibble and the column index in the low nibble.

        For example, the following snippet (from the bbc_microbit board DTS):

          width = <5>;
          height = <5>;
          pixel-mapping = [00 13 01 14 02
                           23 24 25 26 27
                           ...

        specifies that:
        - pixel (0,0) is controlled by row 0 and column 0
        - pixel (1,0) is controlled by row 1 and column 3
        - pixel (0,1) is controlled by row 2 and column 3
        - pixel (1,1) is controlled by row 2 and column 4
        and so on.

    refresh-frequency:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Frequency of refreshing the matrix, in Hz.

    timer:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: |
        Reference to a TIMER instance for controlling refreshing of the matrix.

    pwm:
      type: phandle
      required: false
      description: |
        Reference to a PWM instance for generating pulse signals on column
        GPIOs. If not provided, one PPI and one GPIOTE channel are allocated
        and used instead for generating those pulses.
